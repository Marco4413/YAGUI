To **download YAGUI** you can **run** `pastebin run 5qQ6t6ZX` on your computer!

To **make examples** work you should do "**LIBFILE setup**" **once** you **downloaded** the Library and **every time you move it to another location**.

This is a **remake** of my other **GUI LIB**: [***APLib***](https://github.com/hds536jhmk/APLib)

What does YAGUI stand for? **YAGUI** stands for "Yet Another Graphical User Interface", this library tries to make GUIs easier to make and more powerful by having these objectives:
* Has a Loop that makes **easier event management**;
* Can **draw and get events from multiple monitors**;
* Has a **screen buffer** which makes possible to simulate **transparency** when drawing;
* Has a **rednet based wireless screen sharing** system (Wireless Screen Share, WSS).

***Documentation:***

* **Github Pages**: https://hds536jhmk.github.io/YAGUI/
* **Readthedocs** (Dropped support for it, if you find anything wrong with this documentation don't report it): [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yagui/badge/?version=latest)](https://yagui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

[***Trello Board***](https://trello.com/b/neTyIWej/yagui), where you can find all the things that are planned for the Library!

**CREDITS:**
* **Minified version of the Library is made with this **[***Lua Minifier***](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/mothereff.in/tree/master/lua-minifier)**!**
* **Using **[***MkDocs***](https://www.mkdocs.org/)** to make the docs!**
* **Using **[***CraftOS-PC***](https://github.com/MCJack123/craftos2)** to test performance of the library!**
