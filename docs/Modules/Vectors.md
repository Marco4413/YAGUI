# Vectors

Note that because they're objects **all their methods except for `new` need to be called with ":" between the object and the method** (e.g. `v:length()`).

## Vector2

Vector2 is a **2D vector object**.

### Vector2 Constants

It's got **six constants that are pre-defined vectors**:

| key   | x  | y  |
|-------|----|----|
| ONE   |  1 |  1 |
| UP    |  0 | -1 |
| DOWN  |  0 |  1 |
| LEFT  | -1 |  0 |
| RIGHT |  1 |  0 |
| ZERO  |  0 |  0 |

### Vector2 Methods

*Vector2* : **new**( *number* : **x**, *number* : **y** )

**Returns a new Vector2 that points to (`x`; `y`)**.

```lua
-- Creating a new Vector
local v1 = math_utils.Vector2.new(10, 2)

-- Printing the vector (Note: tostring(v1) will return v1:string(0),
--  if you want more precision you should use v1:string(decimal_digits))
print(v1)
```

*Vector2* : **duplicate**()

**Returns a new Vector2 that has the same x, y as the original Vector2**.

```lua
-- Creating a new Vector
local v1 = math_utils.Vector2.new(10, 2)
-- Creating a reference to v1
local v2 = v1
-- Making a duplicate of v1
local v3 = v1:duplicate()

-- Changing the x value on
--  The reference to v1
v2.x = 5
--  The duplicate of v1
v3.x = 2

--  A referenced vector and a duplicate one
print(v1)
print(v2)
print(v3)
```

*number* : **length_sq**()

**Returns the squared length of the vector** (It's much faster than doing length if you need to compare lengths).
